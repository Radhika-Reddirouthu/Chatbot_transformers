# Chatbot_transformers
The chatbot is designed such that we can have either text based or voice based conversation with it. The chatbot is built using transformer architecture. 

The dataset used for training is basically a combination of many datasets taken from kaggle and few of my own conversations added to it.

To execute the model consider your own dataset and run the cells in the notebook making few changes if required as per the instructions given in the file.

The transformer architecture is developed in reference to the below mentioned blog and github repository

Thankyou to the repository and the blog for giving clear and complete information about transformer architecture.
